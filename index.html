                <p>Hi there! My name is Andres Yance and I'm originally from Colombia. I pursued my passion for technology and innovation by majoring in Computer Science with an emphasis in Supply Chain Management.
                I had the incredible opportunity to attend the University of Wisconsin-Platteville, where I not only focused on my academic pursuits but also honed my skills as a baseball player. As a pitcher, 
                I had the privilege of representing my university's baseball team for four memorable years.
                My time on the field taught me the importance of teamwork, discipline, and perseverance.</p>

              <h3>Project 1 - Library database management system</h3>
              <p>The project is designed as a basic library database management system. 
                The program has two different views: an admin view and a general user view. 
                In the Admin view, users can search, add, and remove users from the system, 
                search, add, and remove books from the system, and view checkouts. 
                In the general user view, users can search for books by different attributes 
                such as title, ISBN, author, and genre, and checkout books. 
                The application runs via a desktop application and is connected to an SQL database 
                where all the information is stored.</p>

              <h3>Project 2 - Fighting Game</h3>
              <p>This program is a prototype of a turn-based fighting game. 
                It allows the player to engage in exciting battles with various opponents. 
                One of the key features is the ability to adjust the game's difficulty level, 
                providing options for both casual and experienced players. Additionally, players 
                can choose their character from a diverse roster, each with unique abilities and playstyles. 
                The game also includes a challenging AI-controlled enemy that can be customized with different 
                difficulty settings. Moreover, players have the freedom to change the background scenes, enhancing 
                the visual experience of the battles. To further enhance gameplay, the prototype includes an in-game 
                store where players can purchase super potions and other power-ups, adding strategic elements to the fights. 
                Overall, this prototype showcases the potential for an immersive and engaging turn-based fighting game experience.</p>
